"""
Vector search service factory.

This module provides the main entry point for vector search operations.
Depending on the configuration (discovery_mode), it will either use:
- Embedded FAISS with sentence-transformers (default, requires heavy dependencies)
- Weaviate-based vector search service (uses WeaviateClient for tool indexing)
As of 2026-02-12, we decide not to use the embedded FAISS service moving forward.
