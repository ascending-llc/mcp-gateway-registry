## What is MCP Gateway & Registry?

The **MCP Gateway & Registry** is an enterprise-ready platform that centralizes access to AI development tools using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). Instead of managing hundreds of individual tool configurations across your development teams, provide secure, governed access to curated AI tools through a single platform.

**Transform this chaos:**
```
❌ Each developer configures VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code individually
❌ Scattered API keys and credentials across tools  
❌ No visibility into what tools teams are using
❌ Security risks from unmanaged tool sprawl
```

**Into this organized approach:**
```
✅ Centralized tool catalog with enterprise governance
✅ Single sign-on through your identity provider
✅ Complete audit trail and compliance ready
✅ Consistent developer experience across all AI assistants
```

---

## 🎯 Core Use Cases

### 🤖 AI Development Tool Governance
Provide developers with secure access to approved AI development tools while maintaining IT oversight and compliance.

### 🔐 Enterprise Security & Compliance  
Centralized authentication, fine-grained permissions, and comprehensive audit trails for SOX/GDPR compliance pathways.

### 🚀 Dynamic Tool Discovery
AI agents can autonomously discover and execute specialized tools beyond their initial capabilities using intelligent semantic search.

### 🏗️ Microservices Integration
Seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise architecture including Amazon Cognito, SAML, and AWS services.

---
